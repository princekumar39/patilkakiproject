           <p>Founded in 2020 by Geeta Patil, Vinit Patil and Darshil Savla, PatilKaki offers a range of homemade Indian snacks  and sweets such as ladoos,
             puranpoli, chakli and more through its own website as well as ecommerce platforms  such as Amazon and Meesho. <br>
             The team eventually accepted an offer from Peyush Bansal and Anupam Mittal who invested ₹40 lakh for 4% equity. As the second season of Shark Tank India airs, 
             the judges have found themselves vying to invest in homegrown food brand PatilKaki.<br>
             The online web platform helped them to expand their sales from 15-20 orders per day to around 3000 orders monthly, as per reports.
